External dependency bundler.
Mods made using Depcat will be bundled into .tmod.depcat files that can only be loaded if using Dependacat.

For developers:
To bundle a dependency with your mod, make a "depcat" folder in your source, and put your libraries in there.
They will automatically get bundled after building.
