External dependency bundler.
Mods with a /Depcat/ directory upon compile will be unpacked by Depcat.
Will export all dependencies to C:\Users\%USER%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\Depcat, or whatever the current TModLoader path is.

Includes unmanaged function pointer calling, but PInvoke obviously also works.
Must use the Depcat.Importer field to get the importer and use the methods.
